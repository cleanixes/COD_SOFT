# AI-CodSoft-Internship
A set of 3-5 projects made for my internship at CodSoft

Batch- September a76

# 1
CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED

RESPONSES

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.

# 2
TIC-TAC-TOE AI

Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project will help you understand game theory and basic search
algorithms.

# 3
IMAGE CAPTIONING

Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build
an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models
like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a
recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to
generate captions for those images.

# 4
FACE DETECTION AND

RECOGNITION

Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in
images or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haar
cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally
add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese
networks or ArcFace.
